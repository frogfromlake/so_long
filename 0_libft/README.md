## Libft
This is the first Project from the 42-Core_Curriculum.<br> 
The task is to create your own C library with some highly useful standard functions for later use.

(Subject to change)
This library is an expanded version of the "original" project and will continue to expand with further projects.

## How to use it:
To use this library for your own code just follow these 4 steps.

**1. Clone the repo**
```
git clone https://github.com/fquist42/Libft.git
```
**2. Make the library**

call Make from libft-folder 
```
make
```
**3. Include the Headerfile in your ```.c``` files**
```c
#include "libft.h"
```
**4. Compile your srcs with the library**
```
gcc your-srcs.c path_to_libft/libft.a -I./path_to_libft/libft/inc
```

<hr>
<b>*All 42 projects must be written in C (later C++) in accordance to the 42 School Norm.<br></b>
<br>

> #### Sample restrictions:
> - All variables have to be declared and aligned at the top of each function.
> - Each function can not have more then 25 lines.
> - Projects should be created with allowed std functions otherwise it is considered cheating.
> - FOR-Loops are forbidden.
> - Etc.
